Project Name:

Enterprise Customer 360° Data Platform

Description:

Built a Customer 360° platform that integrates multiple datasets — transactions, web logs, support tickets — into a single source of truth for comprehensive customer insights. Developed ETL pipelines, feature engineering, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualize key metrics and churn probability.

Key Features & Highlights:

ETL Pipeline: Bronze (raw) → Silver (cleaned) → Gold (master) layers for reproducible workflows.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, duplicates, and format standardization.

Feature Engineering: Calculated RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), CLV, and churn probability.

Machine Learning: Trained RandomForestClassifier for churn prediction; model dynamically generated from scripts.

Interactive Dashboard: Streamlit + Plotly charts for:

Top 10 At-Risk & VIP customers

Transactions distribution

Customer engagement & campaign performance

Churn probability and segment visualization

Business Insights: Enabled actionable insights for marketing, finance, and operations teams.

Skills Demonstrated:

Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Plotly, ETL pipelines, data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning, dashboarding, business analytics.
